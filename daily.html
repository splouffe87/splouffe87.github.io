                      Christ Jesus, I have not been made perfect, but I press on to lay hold of that for which You laid hold of me. I do not consider myself yet to have attained it, but one thing I do: forgetting what is behind and stretching forward to what is ahead, I press on toward the goal to win the prize of the upward call of God in You. <br>(Philippians 3:12 – 14)<br><br>

                      You are the Lord our God, who brought Your people out of Egypt so that they would no longer be slaves; You broke the bars of their yoke and enabled them to walk with heads held high. <br>(Leviticus 26:13)<br><br>

                      Those who sow sparingly will also reap sparingly, and those who sow bountifully will also reap bountifully. Each one should give as he has decided in his heart, not reluctantly or under compulsion; for You love a cheerful giver. And You are able to make all grace abound to us, so that always having all sufficiency in everything, we may abound in every good work. As it is written: “He has scattered abroad His gifts to the poor; His righteousness endures forever.” Now You, the One who supplies seed to the sower and bread for food, will also supply and increase our seed and will increase the fruits of our righteousness. <br>(2 Corinthians 9:6–10)<br><br>
