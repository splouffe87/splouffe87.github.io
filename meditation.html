        Therefore, since we are surrounded by so great a cloud of witnesses, let us also lay aside every weight, and sin which clings so closely, and let us run with endurance the race that is set before us, 2 looking to Jesus, the founder and perfecter of our faith, who for the joy that was set before him endured the cross, despising the shame, and is seated at the right hand of the throne of God.

					  Oh, the depth of the riches and wisdom and knowledge of God! How unsearchable are his judgments and how inscrutable his ways! For who has known the mind of the Lord, or who has been his counselor? Or who has given a gift to him that he might be repaid? For from him and through him and to him are all things. To him be glory forever. Amen. <br>(Romans 11:33-36)<br><br>
					  Now to him who is able to strengthen you according to my gospel and the preaching of Jesus Christ, according to the revelation of the mystery that was kept secret for long ages but has now been disclosed and through the prophetic writings has been made known to all nations, according to the command of the eternal God, to bring about the obedience of faith— to the only wise God be glory forevermore through Jesus Christ!

                     For just as the body is one and has many members, and all the members of the body, though many, are one body, so it is with Christ. <br>(1 Corinthians 12:12)<br><br>
					So with yourselves, since you are eager for manifestations of the Spirit, strive to excel in building up the church. <br>(1 Corinthians 14:12)<br><br>
					Therefore encourage one another and build one another up, just as you are doing. <br>(1 Thessalonians 5:11)<br><br>
					And, apart from other things, there is the daily pressure on me of my anxiety for all the churches. Who is weak, and I am not weak? Who is made to fall, and I am not indignant? <br>(2 Corinthians 11:28-29)<br><br>
					And they devoted themselves to the apostles' teaching and the fellowship, to the breaking of bread and the prayers. And awe came upon every soul, and many wonders and signs were being done through the apostles. And all who believed were together and had all things in common. And they were selling their possessions and belongings and distributing the proceeds to all, as any had need. And day by day, attending the temple together and breaking bread in their homes, they received their food with glad and generous hearts, praising God and having favor with all the people. And the Lord added to their number day by day those who were being saved. <br>(Acts 2:42-47)<br><br>
					 And he gave the apostles, the prophets, the evangelists, the shepherds and teachers, to equip the saints for the work of ministry, for building up the body of Christ, until we all attain to the unity of the faith and of the knowledge of the Son of God, to mature manhood, to the measure of the stature of the fullness of Christ, so that we may no longer be children, tossed to and fro by the waves and carried about by every wind of doctrine, by human cunning, by craftiness in deceitful schemes. Rather, speaking the truth in love, we are to grow up in every way into him who is the head, into Christ, from whom the whole body, joined and held together by every joint with which it is equipped, when each part is working properly, makes the body grow so that it builds itself up in love. <br>(Ephesians 4:11-16)<br><br>
					For as in one body we have many members, and the members do not all have the same function, so we, though many, are one body in Christ, and individually members one of another.<br> (Romans 12:4-5)

					Be watchful, stand firm in the faith, act like men, be strong. Let all that you do be done in love. <br>(1 Corinthians 16:13-14)<br><br>
					Do you not know that in a race all the runners run, but only one receives the prize? So run that you may obtain it.<br> (1 Corinthians 9:24)<br><br>
					But I discipline my body and keep it under control, lest after preaching to others I myself should be disqualified.<br> (1 Corinthians 9:27)<br><br>
					For to this you have been called, because Christ also suffered for you, leaving you an example, so that you might follow in his steps. <br>(1 Peter 2:21)<br><br>
					So we do not lose heart. Though our outer self is wasting away, our inner self is being renewed day by day. For this light momentary affliction is preparing for us an eternal weight of glory beyond all comparison, as we look not to the things that are seen but to the things that are unseen. For the things that are seen are transient, but the things that are unseen are eternal.<br> (2 Corinthians 4:16-18)<br><br>
					For we walk by faith, not by sight. <br>(2 Corinthians 5:7)<br><br>
					For this I toil, struggling with all his energy that he powerfully works within me.<br> (Colossians 1:29)<br><br>
					And let us not grow weary of doing good, for in due season we will reap, if we do not give up. <br>(Galatians 6:9)<br><br>

					I can do all things through him who strengthens me.<br> (Philippians 4:13)<br><br>

						According to his great mercy, he has caused us to be born again to a living hope through the resurrection of Jesus Christ from the dead, to an inheritance that is imperishable, undefiled, and unfading, kept in heaven for you. <br>(1 Peter 1:3-4)<br><br>
						Fight the good fight of the faith. Take hold of the eternal life to which you were called and about which you made the good confession in the presence of many witnesses. <br>(1 Timothy 6:12)<br><br>
						For all the promises of God find their Yes in him. That is why it is through him that we utter our Amen to God for his glory. <br>(2 Corinthians 1:20)<br><br>
						Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, the Father of mercies and God of all comfort, who comforts us in all our affliction, so that we may be able to comfort those who are in any affliction, with the comfort with which we ourselves are comforted by God. <br>(2 Corinthians 1:3-4)<br><br>
						But he said to me, “My grace is sufficient for you, for my power is made perfect in weakness.” Therefore I will boast all the more gladly of my weaknesses, so that the power of Christ may rest upon me.<br> (2 Corinthians 12:9)<br><br>
						For through the Spirit, by faith, we ourselves eagerly wait for the hope of righteousness. <br>(Galatians 5:5)<br><br>
						Every good gift and every perfect gift is from above, coming down from the Father of lights, with whom there is no variation or shadow due to change. <br>(James 1:17)<br><br>
						And I am sure of this, that he who began a good work in you will bring it to completion at the day of Jesus Christ. <br>(Philippians 1:6)<br><br>
						But our citizenship is in heaven, and from it we await a Savior, the Lord Jesus Christ, <br>(Philippians 3:20)<br><br>
						Therefore, since we have been justified by faith, we have peace with God through our Lord Jesus Christ. Through him we have also obtained access by faith into this grace in which we stand, and we rejoice in hope of the glory of God. <br>(Romans 5:1-2)<br><br>
						There is therefore now no condemnation for those who are in Christ Jesus. <br>(Romans 8:1)<br><br>
						For I consider that the sufferings of this present time are not worth comparing with the glory that is to be revealed to us.<br> (Romans 8:18)<br><br>
						And we know that for those who love God all things work together for good, for those who are called according to his purpose. <br>(Romans 8:28)<br><br>
						What then shall we say to these things? If God is for us, who can be against us? He who did not spare his own Son but gave him up for us all, how will he not also with him graciously give us all things? Who shall bring any charge against God's elect? It is God who justifies. Who is to condemn? Christ Jesus is the one who died—more than that, who was raised—who is at the right hand of God, who indeed is interceding for us. <br>(Romans 8:31-34)<br><br>
						Who shall separate us from the love of Christ? Shall tribulation, or distress, or persecution, or famine, or nakedness, or danger, or sword? As it is written, “For your sake we are being killed all the day long; we are regarded as sheep to be slaughtered.” No, in all these things we are more than conquerors through him who loved us.<br> (Romans 8:35-37)<br><br>
						For I am sure that neither death nor life, nor angels nor rulers, nor things present nor things to come, nor powers, nor height nor depth, nor anything else in all creation, will be able to separate us from the love of God in Christ Jesus our Lord. <br>(Romans 9:38-39)

						For consider your calling, brothers: not many of you were wise according to worldly standards, not many were powerful, not many were of noble birth. But God chose what is foolish in the world to shame the wise; God chose what is weak in the world to shame the strong. <br>(1 Corinthians 1:26-27)<br><br>
						Therefore let anyone who thinks that he stands take heed lest he fall. <br>(1 Corinthians 10:12)<br><br>

						So neither he who plants nor he who waters is anything, but only God who gives the growth. <br>(1 Corinthians 3:7)<br><br>
						Therefore do not pronounce judgment before the time, before the Lord comes, who will bring to light the things now hidden in darkness and will disclose the purposes of the heart. Then each one will receive his commendation from God. <br>(1 Corinthians 4:5)<br><br>
						For who sees anything different in you? What do you have that you did not receive? If then you received it, why do you boast as if you did not receive it? <br>(1 Corinthians 4:7)<br><br>
						Your boasting is not good. Do you not know that a little leaven leavens the whole lump?<br> (1 Corinthians 5:6)<br><br>
						Humble yourselves, therefore, under the mighty hand of God so that at the proper time he may exalt you, casting all your anxieties on him, because he cares for you. <br>(1 Peter 5:6-7)<br><br>
						But godliness with contentment is great gain, for we brought nothing into the world, and we cannot take anything out of the world. <br>(1 Timothy 6:6-7)<br><br>
						“Let the one who boasts, boast in the Lord.” For it is not the one who commends himself who is approved, but the one whom the Lord commends. <br>(2 Corinthians 10:17-18)<br><br>
						Examine yourselves, to see whether you are in the faith. Test yourselves. Or do you not realize this about yourselves, that Jesus Christ is in you?—unless indeed you fail to meet the test! <br>(2 Corinthians 13:5)<br><br>
						But we have this treasure in jars of clay, to show that the surpassing power belongs to God and not to us. <br>(2 Corinthians 4:7)<br><br>
						Who is wise and understanding among you? By his good conduct let him show his works in the meekness of wisdom.<br> (James 3:13)<br><br>
						Submit yourselves therefore to God. Resist the devil, and he will flee from you. Draw near to God, and he will draw near to you. <br>(James 4:7-8)<br><br>
						But it shall not be so among you. But whoever would be great among you must be your servant, and whoever would be first among you must be slave of all. For even the Son of Man came not to be served but to serve, and to give his life as a ransom for many.” <br>(Mark 10:43-45)<br><br>
						And when Jesus heard it, he said to them, “Those who are well have no need of a physician, but those who are sick. I came not to call the righteous, but sinners.” <br>(Mark 2:17)<br><br>
						Do nothing from selfish ambition or conceit, but in humility count others more significant than yourselves. Let each of you look not only to his own interests, but also to the interests of others.<br> (Philippians 2:3-4)<br><br>
						Brothers, I do not consider that I have made it my own. But one thing I do: forgetting what lies behind and straining forward to what lies ahead, I press on toward the goal for the prize of the upward call of God in Christ Jesus. <br>(Philippians 3:13-14)<br><br>
						For by the grace given to me I say to everyone among you not to think of himself more highly than he ought to think, but to think with sober judgment, each according to the measure of faith that God has assigned. <br>(Romans 12:3)<br><br>
						We who are strong have an obligation to bear with the failings of the weak, and not to please ourselves. Let each of us please his neighbor for his good, to build him up. For Christ did not please himself, but as it is written, “The reproaches of those who reproached you fell on me.” <br>(Romans 15:1-3)

						but as he who called you is holy, you also be holy in all your conduct, since it is written, “You shall be holy, for I am holy.” <br>(1 Peter 1:15)<br><br>
						But you are a chosen race, a royal priesthood, a holy nation, a people for his own possession, that you may proclaim the excellencies of him who called you out of darkness into his marvelous light. Once you were not a people, but now you are God's people; once you had not received mercy, but now you have received mercy.<br> (1 Peter 2:9-10)<br><br>
						The saying is trustworthy and deserving of full acceptance, that Christ Jesus came into the world to save sinners, of whom I am the foremost. But I received mercy for this reason, that in me, as the foremost, Jesus Christ might display his perfect patience as an example to those who were to believe in him for eternal life. <br>(1 Timothy 1:15-16)<br><br>
						Let no one despise you for your youth, but set the believers an example in speech, in conduct, in love, in faith, in purity. <br>(1 Timothy 4:12)<br><br>
						Therefore, if anyone is in Christ, he is a new creation. The old has passed away; behold, the new has come. All this is from God, who through Christ reconciled us to himself and gave us the ministry of reconciliation; that is, in Christ God was reconciling the world to himself, not counting their trespasses against them, and entrusting to us the message of reconciliation. Therefore, we are ambassadors for Christ, God making his appeal through us. We implore you on behalf of Christ, be reconciled to God. For our sake he made him to be sin who knew no sin, so that in him we might become the righteousness of God. <br>(2 Corinthians 5:17-21)<br><br>
						Walk as children of light (for the fruit of light is found in all that is good and right and true), and try to discern what is pleasing to the Lord. <br>(Ephesians 5:8-10)<br><br>
						I have been crucified with Christ. It is no longer I who live, but Christ who lives in me. And the life I now live in the flesh I live by faith in the Son of God, who loved me and gave himself for me. <br>(Galatians 2:20)<br><br>
						And because you are sons, God has sent the Spirit of his Son into our hearts, crying, “Abba! Father!” So you are no longer a slave, but a son, and if a son, then an heir through God.<br> (Galatians 4:4-6)<br><br>
						For to me to live is Christ, and to die is gain.<br> (Philippians 1:21)<br><br>
						For none of us lives to himself, and none of us dies to himself. For if we live, we live to the Lord, and if we die, we die to the Lord. So then, whether we live or whether we die, we are the Lord's. <br>(Romans 14:7-8)<br><br>
						For you did not receive the spirit of slavery to fall back into fear, but you have received the Spirit of adoption as sons, by whom we cry, “Abba! Father!” The Spirit himself bears witness with our spirit that we are children of God, and if children, then heirs—heirs of God and fellow heirs with Christ, provided we suffer with him in order that we may also be glorified with him. <br>(Romans 8:15-17)<br><br>
						For we know that the whole creation has been groaning together in the pains of childbirth until now. And not only the creation, but we ourselves, who have the firstfruits of the Spirit, groan inwardly as we wait eagerly for adoption as sons, the redemption of our bodies.<br> (Romans 8:22-23)<br><br>
						Show yourself in all respects to be a model of good works, and in your teaching show integrity, dignity, and sound speech that cannot be condemned, so that an opponent may be put to shame, having nothing evil to say about us. <br>(Titus 2:7-8)

						And calling the crowd to him with his disciples, he said to them, “If anyone would come after me, let him deny himself and take up his cross and follow me. For whoever would save his life will lose it, but whoever loses his life for my sake and the gospel's will save it. For what does it profit a man to gain the whole world and forfeit his soul?

						So now faith, hope, and love abide, these three; but the greatest of these is love.<br> (1 Corinthians 13:13)<br><br>
						Love is patient and kind; love does not envy or boast; it is not arrogant or rude. It does not insist on its own way; it is not irritable or resentful; it does not rejoice at wrongdoing, but rejoices with the truth. Love bears all things, believes all things, hopes all things, endures all things.<br> (1 Corinthians 13:4-7)<br><br>
						Love never ends. As for prophecies, they will pass away; as for tongues, they will cease; as for knowledge, it will pass away. For we know in part and we prophesy in part, but when the perfect comes, the partial will pass away. When I was a child, I spoke like a child, I thought like a child, I reasoned like a child. When I became a man, I gave up childish ways. For now we see in a mirror dimly, but then face to face. Now I know in part; then I shall know fully, even as I have been fully known. <br>(1 Corinthians 13:8-12)<br><br>
						We know that “all of us possess knowledge.” This “knowledge” puffs up, but love builds up. If anyone imagines that he knows something, he does not yet know as he ought to know. But if anyone loves God, he is known by God. <br>(1 Corinthians 8:1-3)<br><br>
						By this we know love, that he laid down his life for us, and we ought to lay down our lives for the brothers. <br>(1 John 3:16)<br><br>
						In this is love, not that we have loved God but that he loved us and sent his Son to be the propitiation for our sins. <br>(1 John 4:10)<br><br>
						No one has ever seen God; if we love one another, God abides in us and his love is perfected in us.<br> (1 John 4:12)<br><br>
						There is no fear in love, but perfect love casts out fear. For fear has to do with punishment, and whoever fears has not been perfected in love.<br> (1 John 4:18)<br><br>
						We love because he first loved us. <br>(1 John 4:19)<br><br>
						Beloved, let us love one another, for love is from God, and whoever loves has been born of God and knows God. 8 Anyone who does not love does not know God, because God is love.<br> (1 John 4:7-8)<br><br>
						For this is the love of God, that we keep his commandments. And his commandments are not burdensome.<br> (1 John 5:3)<br><br>
						For the love of Christ controls us, because we have concluded this: that one has died for all, therefore all have died; and he died for all, that those who live might no longer live for themselves but for him who for their sake died and was raised.<br> (2 Corinthians 5:14-15)<br><br>
						For you were called to freedom, brothers. Only do not use your freedom as an opportunity for the flesh, but through love serve one another. For the whole law is fulfilled in one word: “You shall love your neighbor as yourself.”<br> (Galatians 5:13-14)<br><br>
						Owe no one anything, except to love each other, for the one who loves another has fulfilled the law. <br>(Romans 13:8)<br><br>
						For the commandments, “You shall not commit adultery, You shall not murder, You shall not steal, You shall not covet,” and any other commandment, are summed up in this word: “You shall love your neighbor as yourself.” Love does no wrong to a neighbor; therefore love is the fulfilling of the law.<br> (Romans 13:9-10)

						But I, brothers, could not address you as spiritual people, but as people of the flesh, as infants in Christ. <br>(1 Corinthians 3:1)<br><br>
						For this is the will of God, your sanctification: that you abstain from sexual immorality; that each one of you know how to control his own body in holiness and honor. <br>(1 Thessalonians 4:3-4)<br><br>
						Rejoice always, pray without ceasing, give thanks in all circumstances; for this is the will of God in Christ Jesus for you. Do not quench the Spirit.<br> (1 Thessalonians 5:16-19)<br><br>
						Rather train yourself for godliness; for while bodily training is of some value, godliness is of value in every way, as it holds promise for the present life and also for the life to come.<br> (1 Timothy 4:7-8)<br><br>
						Finally, brothers, rejoice. Aim for restoration, comfort one another, agree with one another, live in peace; and the God of love and peace will be with you.<br> (2 Corinthians 13:11)<br><br>
						For this very reason, make every effort to supplement your faith with virtue, and virtue with knowledge, and knowledge with self-control, and self-control with steadfastness, and steadfastness with godliness, and godliness with brotherly affection, and brotherly affection with love. For if these qualities are yours and are increasing, they keep you from being ineffective or unfruitful in the knowledge of our Lord Jesus Christ. <br>(2 Peter 1:5-8)<br><br>
						As for you, brothers, do not grow weary in doing good.<br> (2 Thessalonians 3:13)<br><br>
						If then you have been raised with Christ, seek the things that are above, where Christ is, seated at the right hand of God. Set your minds on things that are above, not on things that are on earth.<br> (Colossians 3:1-2)<br><br>
						Let your speech always be gracious, seasoned with salt, so that you may know how you ought to answer each person. <br>(Colossians 4:6)<br><br>
						 to put off your old self, which belongs to your former manner of life and is corrupt through deceitful desires, and to be renewed in the spirit of your minds, and to put on the new self, created after the likeness of God in true righteousness and holiness. <br>(Ephesians 4:22-24)<br><br>
						 Be angry and do not sin; do not let the sun go down on your anger, and give no opportunity to the devil. (Ephesians 4:26-27)<br><br>
						 Look carefully then how you walk, not as unwise but as wise, making the best use of the time, because the days are evil. <br>(Epheisans 5:15-16)<br><br>
						But the fruit of the Spirit is love, joy, peace, patience, kindness, goodness, faithfulness, gentleness, self-control; against such things there is no law.<br> (Galatians 5:22-23)<br><br>
						But be doers of the word, and not hearers only, deceiving yourselves. <br>(James 1:22)<br><br>
						So also faith by itself, if it does not have works, is dead. <br>(James 2:17)<br><br>
						Finally, brothers, whatever is true, whatever is honorable, whatever is just, whatever is pure, whatever is lovely, whatever is commendable, if there is any excellence, if there is anything worthy of praise, think about these things. <br>(Philippians 4:8)<br><br>
						I appeal to you therefore, brothers, by the mercies of God, to present your bodies as a living sacrifice, holy and acceptable to God, which is your spiritual worship. Do not be conformed to this world, but be transformed by the renewal of your mind, that by testing you may discern what is the will of God, what is good and acceptable and perfect. <br>(Romans 12:1-2)<br><br>
						Do not be slothful in zeal, be fervent in spirit, serve the Lord. Rejoice in hope, be patient in tribulation, be constant in prayer. Contribute to the needs of the saints and seek to show hospitality. Bless those who persecute you; bless and do not curse them. <br>(Romans 12:11-14)<br><br>
						Rejoice with those who rejoice, weep with those who weep. Live in harmony with one another. Do not be haughty, but associate with the lowly. Never be wise in your own sight. Repay no one evil for evil, but give thought to do what is honorable in the sight of all. If possible, so far as it depends on you, live peaceably with all.<br> (Romans 12:15-18)<br><br>
						Let love be genuine. Abhor what is evil; hold fast to what is good. Love one another with brotherly affection. Outdo one another in showing honor.<br> (Romans 12:9-10)<br><br>
						Pay to all what is owed to them: taxes to whom taxes are owed, revenue to whom revenue is owed, respect to whom respect is owed, honor to whom honor is owed. <br>(Romans 13:7)<br><br>
						for it is written, “As I live, says the Lord, every knee shall bow to me, and every tongue shall confess to God.” So then each of us will give an account of himself to God. Therefore let us not pass judgment on one another any longer, but rather decide never to put a stumbling block or hindrance in the way of a brother.<br> (Romans 14:11-13)<br><br>
						For the grace of God has appeared, bringing salvation for all people, training us to renounce ungodliness and worldly passions, and to live self-controlled, upright, and godly lives in the present age. <br>(Titus 2:11-12)

						For the word of the cross is folly to those who are perishing, but to us who are being saved it is the power of God. <br>(1 Corinthians 1:18)<br><br>
						Now if anyone builds on the foundation with gold, silver, precious stones, wood, hay, straw - each one's work will become manifest, for the Day will disclose it, because it will be revealed by fire, and the fire will test what sort of work each one has done.<br> (1 Corinthians 3:12-13)<br><br>
						Moreover, it is required of stewards that they be found faithful. But with me it is a very small thing that I should be judged by you or by any human court. In fact, I do not even judge myself. <br>(1 Corinthians 4:2-3)<br><br>
						For though I am free from all, I have made myself a servant to all, that I might win more of them. <br>(1 Corinthians 9:19)<br><br>
						To the weak I became weak, that I might win the weak. I have become all things to all people, that by all means I might save some. <br>(1 Corinthians 9:22)<br><br>
						but in your hearts honor Christ the Lord as holy, always being prepared to make a defense to anyone who asks you for a reason for the hope that is in you; yet do it with gentleness and respect.<br> (1 Peter 3:15)<br><br>
						shepherd the flock of God that is among you, exercising oversight, not under compulsion, but willingly, as God would have you; not for shameful gain, but eagerly; not domineering over those in your charge, but being examples to the flock. And when the chief Shepherd appears, you will receive the unfading crown of glory.<br> (1 Peter 5:2-4)<br><br>
						For you know how, like a father with his children, we exhorted each one of you and encouraged you and charged you to walk in a manner worthy of God, who calls you into his own kingdom and glory.<br> (1 Thessalonians 2:11-12)<br><br>
						who desires all people to be saved and to come to the knowledge of the truth. <br>(1 Timothy 2:4)<br><br>
						For to this end we toil and strive, because we have our hope set on the living God, who is the Savior of all people, especially of those who believe. <br>(1 Timothy 4:10)<br><br>
						Therefore, having this ministry by the mercy of God, we do not lose heart.<br> (2 Corinthians 4:1)<br><br>
						In their case the god of this world has blinded the minds of the unbelievers, to keep them from seeing the light of the gospel of the glory of Christ, who is the image of God. <br>(2 Corinthians 4:4)<br><br>
						We have spoken freely to you, Corinthians; our heart is wide open. You are not restricted by us, but you are restricted in your own affections. In return (I speak as to children) widen your hearts also. <br>(2 Corinthians 6:11-13)<br><br>
						But there were some of them, men of Cyprus and Cyrene, who on coming to Antioch spoke to the Hellenists also, preaching the Lord Jesus. <br>(Acts 11:20)<br><br>
						Therefore be alert, remembering that for three years I did not cease night or day to admonish every one with tears.<br> (Acts 20:31)<br><br>
						Proclaiming the kingdom of God and teaching about the Lord Jesus Christ with all boldness and without hindrance.<br> (Acts 28:31)<br><br>
						My little children, for whom I am again in the anguish of childbirth until Christ is formed in you!<br> (Galatians 4:19)<br><br>
						My brothers, if anyone among you wanders from the truth and someone brings him back, let him know that whoever brings back a sinner from his wandering will save his soul from death and will cover a multitude of sins. <br>(James 5:19-20)<br><br>
						So faith comes from hearing, and hearing through the word of Christ.<br> (Romans 10:17)<br><br>
						I am speaking the truth in Christ—I am not lying; my conscience bears me witness in the Holy Spirit— that I have great sorrow and unceasing anguish in my heart.

The Lord is not slow to fulfill his promise as some count slowness, but is patient toward you, not wishing that any should perish, but that all should reach repentance. <br>(2 Peter 3:8-9)<br><br>
					So Peter opened his mouth and said: “Truly I understand that God shows no partiality, but in every nation anyone who fears him and does what is right is acceptable to him. <br>(Acts 10:34-35)<br><br>
					And there is salvation in no one else, for there is no other name under heaven given among men by which we must be saved.” <br>(Acts 4:12)<br><br>
					And you, who were dead in your trespasses and the uncircumcision of your flesh, God made alive together with him, having forgiven us all our trespasses, by canceling the record of debt that stood against us with its legal demands. This he set aside, nailing it to the cross. <br>(Colossians 2:13-14)<br><br>
					 For by grace you have been saved through faith. And this is not your own doing; it is the gift of God, not a result of works, so that no one may boast. For we are his workmanship, created in Christ Jesus for good works, which God prepared beforehand, that we should walk in them.<br> (Ephesians 2:8-10)<br><br>
					Now it is evident that no one is justified before God by the law, for “The righteous shall live by faith.” <br>(Galatians 3:11)<br><br>
					because, if you confess with your mouth that Jesus is Lord and believe in your heart that God raised him from the dead, you will be saved. For with the heart one believes and is justified, and with the mouth one confesses and is saved.<br> (Romans 10:9-10)<br><br>
					The righteousness of God through faith in Jesus Christ for all who believe. For there is no distinction: for all have sinned and fall short of the glory of God, and are justified by his grace as a gift, through the redemption that is in Christ Jesus,<br> (Romans 3:22-24)<br><br>
					For if Abraham was justified by works, he has something to boast about, but not before God. For what does the Scripture say? “Abraham believed God, and it was counted to him as righteousness.” <br>(Romans 4:2-3)<br><br>
					Just as David also speaks of the blessing of the one to whom God counts righteousness apart from works: “Blessed are those whose lawless deeds are forgiven, and whose sins are covered; blessed is the man against whom the Lord will not count his sin.” <br>(Romans 4:6-8)<br><br>
					For while we were still weak, at the right time Christ died for the ungodly. For one will scarcely die for a righteous person—though perhaps for a good person one would dare even to die— but God shows his love for us in that while we were still sinners, Christ died for us. <br>(Romans 5:6-8)<br><br>
					Since, therefore, we have now been justified by his blood, much more shall we be saved by him from the wrath of God. For if while we were enemies we were reconciled to God by the death of his Son, much more, now that we are reconciled, shall we be saved by his life. <br>(Romans 5:9-10)<br><br>
					For the wages of sin is death, but the free gift of God is eternal life in Christ Jesus our Lord.<br> (Romans 6:23)

						No temptation has overtaken you that is not common to man. God is faithful, and he will not let you be tempted beyond your ability, but with the temptation he will also provide the way of escape, that you may be able to endure it.<br> (1 Corinthians 10:13)<br><br>
						Be sober-minded; be watchful. Your adversary the devil prowls around like a roaring lion, seeking someone to devour. Resist him, firm in your faith, knowing that the same kinds of suffering are being experienced by your brotherhood throughout the world.<br> (1 Peter 5:8-9)<br><br>
						The sins of some people are conspicuous, going before them to judgment, but the sins of others appear later. <br>(1 Timothy 5:24)<br><br>
						For the love of money is a root of all kinds of evils. It is through this craving that some have wandered away from the faith and pierced themselves with many pangs.<br> (1 Timothy 6:10)<br><br>
						For if, after they have escaped the defilements of the world through the knowledge of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ, they are again entangled in them and overcome, the last state has become worse for them than the first. For it would have been better for them never to have known the way of righteousness than after knowing it to turn back from the holy commandment delivered to them.<br> (2 Peter 2:20-21)<br><br>
						See to it that no one takes you captive by philosophy and empty deceit, according to human tradition, according to the elemental spirits of the world, and not according to Christ.<br> (Colossians 2:8)<br><br>
						But I say, walk by the Spirit, and you will not gratify the desires of the flesh. For the desires of the flesh are against the Spirit, and the desires of the Spirit are against the flesh, for these are opposed to each other, to keep you from doing the things you want to do. <br>(Galatians 5:16-17)<br><br>
						Do not be deceived: God is not mocked, for whatever one sows, that will he also reap.<br> (Galatians 6:7)<br><br>
						So also the tongue is a small member, yet it boasts of great things. How great a forest is set ablaze by such a small fire! <br>(James 3:5)<br><br>
						What causes quarrels and what causes fights among you? Is it not this, that your passions are at war within you? You desire and do not have, so you murder. You covet and cannot obtain, so you fight and quarrel. You do not have, because you do not ask.<br> (James 4:1-2)<br><br>
						“‘This people honors me with their lips, but their heart is far from me; in vain do they worship me, teaching as doctrines the commandments of men.’<br> (Mark 7:6-7)<br><br>
						For what can be known about God is plain to them, because God has shown it to them. For his invisible attributes, namely, his eternal power and divine nature, have been clearly perceived, ever since the creation of the world, in the things that have been made. So they are without excuse.<br> (Romans 1:19-20)<br><br>
						For although they knew God, they did not honor him as God or give thanks to him, but they became futile in their thinking, and their foolish hearts were darkened. Claiming to be wise, they became fools <br>(Romans 1:21-22)<br><br>
						But put on the Lord Jesus Christ, and make no provision for the flesh, to gratify its desires. (Romans 13:14)<br><br>
						I appeal to you, brothers, to watch out for those who cause divisions and create obstacles contrary to the doctrine that you have been taught; avoid them. For such persons do not serve our Lord Christ, but their own appetites, and by smooth talk and flattery they deceive the hearts of the naive.<br> (Romans 16:17-18)<br><br>
						Do you suppose, O man—you who judge those who practice such things and yet do them yourself—that you will escape the judgment of God? Or do you presume on the riches of his kindness and forbearance and patience, not knowing that God's kindness is meant to lead you to repentance? <br>(Romans 2:3-4)<br><br>
						“None is righteous, no, not one; no one understands; no one seeks for God. All have turned aside; together they have become worthless; no one does good, not even one.” <br>(Romans 3:10-11)<br><br>
						Let not sin therefore reign in your mortal body, to make you obey its passions. Do not present your members to sin as instruments for unrighteousness, but present yourselves to God as those who have been brought from death to life, and your members to God as instruments for righteousness. For sin will have no dominion over you, since you are not under law but under grace.<br> (Romans 6:12-14)<br><br>
						For when you were slaves of sin, you were free in regard to righteousness. But what fruit were you getting at that time from the things of which you are now ashamed? For the end of those things is death. But now that you have been set free from sin and have become slaves of God, the fruit you get leads to sanctification and its end, eternal life.<br> (Romans 6:20-22)<br><br>
						For I know that nothing good dwells in me, that is, in my flesh. For I have the desire to do what is right, but not the ability to carry it out. For I do not do the good I want, but the evil I do not want is what I keep on doing. Now if I do what I do not want, it is no longer I who do it, but sin that dwells within me... Wretched man that I am! Who will deliver me from this body of death? Thanks be to God through Jesus Christ our Lord! So then, I myself serve the law of God with my mind, but with my flesh I serve the law of sin. <br>(Romans 7:18-25)<br><br>

						Not that we are sufficient in ourselves to claim anything as coming from us, but our sufficiency is from God<br> (2 Corinthians 3:5)<br><br>

						Do not love the world or the things in the world. If anyone loves the world, the love of the Father is not in him. For all that is in the world—the desires of the flesh and the desires of the eyes and pride of life—is not from the Father but is from the world. <br>(1 John 2:15-16)<br><br>
						Do not be unequally yoked with unbelievers. For what partnership has righteousness with lawlessness? Or what fellowship has light with darkness? <br>(2 Corinthians 6:14)<br><br>
